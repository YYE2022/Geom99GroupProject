  <h2>Our Methods of Providing a Better Web Map</h2>
  <p>The following methods demonstrated on this page will show our processes and the approaches we took, along with any failings or successes we had towards our solution</p>

  <h2>Acquiring the Data</h2>
  <p>The data was obtained from the ArcGIS Rest Server for the Ministry of Environment and their MapServer. This is based off of Land Information Ontario (LIO) where the data containing the water quality as well as the watercourse and waterstations
    feature classes are located. This was the primary set data we used in conjunction with technologies we constructed to provide a solution</p> 
  <p>The map server containing the data can be found by the link <a href="https://ws.lioservices.lrc.gov.on.ca/arcgis2/rest/services/MOE/PWQMN/MapServer">here</a>. It contains three layers and is shown in the image below. The items from these layers 
  were then incorporated into our ArcGIS Online accounts, and more specifically as items within our groups (Web 6) content.</p>
