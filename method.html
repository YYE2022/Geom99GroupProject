  <h2>Our Methods of Providing a Better Web Map</h2>
  <p>The following methods demonstrated on this page will show our processes and the approaches we took, along with any failings or successes we had towards our solution</p>
  <hr></hr>
  <h2>Acquiring the Data</h2>
  <p>The data was obtained from the ArcGIS Rest Server for the Ministry of Environment and their MapServer. This is based off of Land Information Ontario (LIO) where the data containing the water quality as well as the watercourse and waterstations
    feature classes are located. This was the primary set data we used in conjunction with technologies we constructed to provide a solution</p> 
  <p>The map server containing the data can be found by the link <a href="https://ws.lioservices.lrc.gov.on.ca/arcgis2/rest/services/MOE/PWQMN/MapServer">here</a>. It contains three layers and is shown in the image below. The items from these layers 
  were then incorporated into our ArcGIS Online accounts, and more specifically as items within our groups (Web 6) content.</p>

<div class="main">
  <p>The two layers primarily used were the <a href="https://ws.lioservices.lrc.gov.on.ca/arcgis2/rest/services/MOE/PWQMN/MapServer/0">PWQMN Stations - Small</a> layer and the <a href="https://ws.lioservices.lrc.gov.on.ca/arcgis2/rest/services/MOE/PWQMN/MapServer/2">OHN Watercourse</a>
    layer. They were brought over into the ArcGIS Online group content for Web 6 as items to be used in coding web applications using the Javascript API and Esri Leaflet from ArcGIS Developers. Below are snapshots of those feature layers:

  <h2>Constructing a Solution through Esri Leaflet and ArcGIS Developer</h2>
  <p>Using the Javascript API key from an ArcGIS Developers account, A solution was contructed that zoomed in on the watercourses location. Javscript was coded to enable popups on stations that contained
    water quality data on Chlorides, Nitrates and Phosphates, and have these stations point at the rivers in the watercourse where the reading was taken. 
    Through research, the threshold of dangerous levels of these macronutrients was determined, levels which would contribute to algae blooms and unhealthy water quality. The Javascript that was coded also enabled
    queries on the web app, which would allow the user to click on the stations that contained dangerous readings of these macronutrients after choosing through a drop down menu. This code was enabled by the Esri Leaflet plugin.

<h3 class="main">Below shows the API Key generated in ArcGIS Developers along with the HTML, CSS and Javascript code using the Esri Leaflet Plugin for the web solution:</h3>

  <h2>Issues with the Solution</h2>
  <p>There were some attempts to improve the solution, primarily to highlight the watercourses themselves and have them be color coded based on the information from the water stations. However, there weren't enough attributes between water stations in enough locations (tied to the watercourse)
    that can enable a consistent symbology within the watercourse. More improvements can be made upon this solution such as imrpoving the topological rules of the watercourse feature layer, and havethe popups from the station contain more information for specific use cases (rather then just
    for algae bloom monitoring)
